# DAO DAPP

This project implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a voting mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to:

Claim free tokens or purchase tokens to participate in voting.
Create proposals with a specified voting period.
Vote on proposals using tokens.
Proposals are finalized based on the number of votes, with a quorum mechanism to ensure meaningful participation.
Includes admin functions for managing proposal fees, token distribution, and contract funds.
Built using Solidity 0.8.20 and OpenZeppelin for security features like ReentrancyGuard.
