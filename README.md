# DAO DAPP

This project implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a voting mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to:

1. Claim free tokens or purchase tokens to participate in voting.

2. Create proposals with a specified voting period.

3. Vote on proposals using tokens.

4. Proposals are finalized based on the number of votes, with a quorum mechanism to ensure meaningful participation.

5. Includes admin functions for managing proposal fees, token distribution, and contract funds.

Built using Solidity 0.8.20 and OpenZeppelin for security features like ReentrancyGuard.

## Deployed on Sepolia Testnet, requires Sepolia ETH to function.
